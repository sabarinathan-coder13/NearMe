                The Thanjavur Maratha Palace, also known as the Nayak Palace, is a historic monument in Thanjavur,
        Tamil Nadu, India. Originally constructed by Nayak rulers in the 16th century, it was later expanded 
        by Maratha rulers in the 17th century. The palace served as the official residence of the Bhonsle
        Maratha dynasty from 1674 to 1855.

        Construction began under Nayak king Sevappa Nayak and was completed by his successors. The
        Maratha rulers, originally from Maharashtra, later took control and made significant architectural
        additions. The palace complex encompasses multiple buildings, courtyards, and gardens.
