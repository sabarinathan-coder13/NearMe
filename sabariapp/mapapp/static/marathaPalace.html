        The Thanjavur Maratha Palace, also known as the Nayak Palace, is a historic monument in Thanjavur,<br>
        Tamil Nadu, India. Originally constructed by Nayak rulers in the 16th century, it was later expanded <br>
        by Maratha rulers in the 17th century. The palace served as the official residence of the Bhonsle<br>
        Maratha dynasty from 1674 to 1855.<br>
        <br>

        Construction began under Nayak king Sevappa Nayak and was completed by his successors. The<br>
        Maratha rulers, originally from Maharashtra, later took control and made significant architectural<br>
        additions. The palace complex encompasses multiple buildings, courtyards, and gardens.<br>
        <br>

        Its architecture blends Dravidian and Maratha styles, featuring intricate carvings, ornate pillars,<br>
        and grand arches. A museum within the palace displays artifacts including royal regalia, weaponry,<br>
        paintings, and sculptures. Recognized as a protected monument by the Archaeological Survey of India,<br>
         the Thanjavur Maratha Palace represents the region’s rich cultural and architectural heritage.<br>
